    "\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "\"As of April 2025, over 5,867 exoplanets have been confirmed across 4,341 planetary systems discovered. However, there are only about 150 exoplanets (2-3% of all) from which we have obtained atmospheric data. About 217 exoplanets are confirmed to be terrestrial systems like our Earth. https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/discoveries-dashboard/\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project this summer is to download, visualize and analyze current exoplanet dataset, identifying patterns that would indicate systematic trends, and reason these trends using statistical tools. We will relate terrestrial exoplanets to factors such as the host star mass, metallicity, activity levels, and disk characteristics which can significantly influence the occurrence and characteristics of terrestrial exoplanets. Low-mass stars with moderate metallicities and stable environments are particularly favorable for forming rocky planets that might support life. Understanding these relationships is crucial for identifying habitable worlds in future surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will learn how to work with exoplanet datasets from NASA, perform data visualization & analysis using python, and discover systematic trends & validating these trends to confirm/refute various hypotheses on terrestrial exoplanet formation theories.\"\n",
