Stellar Radial Velocity (st_radv): how fast the host star moves toward or away from Earth

Stellar Metallicitty (st_met): Metal content of star compared to hydrogen (Want moderalte metallicity, around -0.02 to 0.02 dex)

Stellar Luminosity (st_lum): Total energy star emits per unit time (power output)

### Star System Terms

RA: Right Ascension, basically longitude

Dec: Declination, basically latitude

Parallax (sy_plx): Apparent shift in position of system when viewed from another point in Earth's orbit

Distance from Earth (sy_dist): Distance from earth to Exoplanet system

Note for below: The following entries measure the brightness of the exoplanet's host star using certain light filters.

Effective Wavelength Midpoint (EWM) is the wavelength wehre the filter is most sensitive, and is listed as well. The filters below are sorted from lowest to highest EWM; the lower values are ultraviolet and blue filters that are better for broad atmospheric data, while higher values are red and help detect heat signatures and surface details.

Multiple surveys were used:
* Johnson is a traditional optical photometric system covering the ultraviolet to visible range. Cousins is an extension that focuses on red and infrared.
* The Sloan Digital Sky Survey uses a wide variety of filters optimized for galaxy surveys and stellar classification. 
* The Two Micron All-Sky Survay (2MASS) focuses on the near-infrared band.
* The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) uses mid-infrared light to study star formation, galaxies, and planetary disks.
* Gaia was a space observatory that used broadband filters to measure stellar positions, parallaxes, and motions.
* The Kepler Space Telescope used a broadband, red and visual-centered filter to detect exoplanets.
* The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telecope that uses a broadband filter centered on the very near-infrared to detect exoplanet transits.
